# README
Decompile the `Menus.ctmenu` resource from dll/cto.

You can either save it to a `.vsct` file, use its in-memory structures.

My goal is to use it to read the commands, buttons and icons defined in Visual Studio packages & generate a cache file or a source file (using a C# source generator) that QuickJump2022 will be able to use for its known commands.
